# Spell-Checker in C ðŸ’»

This code is a simple and efficient implementation of the widely used spell-checking software.

Here in my program, I have first stored all the words in the dictionary.txt using a trie. Then to check the spelling of the word we iterate through the same trie.
To suggest correct words, here I have used Trie and Levenshtein distance algorithm.

This is the sample output of the code.

To know more about the code refer to the article I have written on it.
